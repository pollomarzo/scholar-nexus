# Who We Are

## Scholar Nexus

**Scholar Nexus** is a prototype for a new type of scientific journaling platform, built on principles of open science and immediate knowledge dissemination. We're reimagining how scientific research is published, reviewed, and shared in the digital age.

### Our Vision

Traditional academic publishing operates on outdated models that prioritize gatekeeping over knowledge sharing. Scholar Nexus represents a fundamentally different approach:

- **Immediate Open Access**: All research is freely accessible to anyone, anywhere
- **Post-Publication Peer Review**: Real-time community evaluation rather than pre-publication bottlenecks
- **Open Standards**: Built on open-source technologies to ensure long-term accessibility
- **Transparent Science**: Making the scientific process visible and collaborative
