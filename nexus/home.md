# A Moft Humble Propofal for the Advancement of Natural Philofophy


It hath come to Our Attention that the prefent Syftem of fcholarly Difcourfe doth labour under moft grievous Impediments to the Advancement of Knowledge. The Ancient Method requireth that a Man of Learning fubmit his Obfervations to a Star Chamber of Anonymous Learned Men, who may deliberate for Months or even Years whilft the Difcovery grows ftale as Yesterday's Bread. Worfe ftill, thefe Gatekeepers do demand Coin of the Realm merely for the Privilege of reading what other Scholars have writ, as if Knowledge itfelf were a Commodity to be hoarded like Spice from the Indies, or Holy Scripture locked in Latin away from the Common Man. We do obferve that more Time is fpent awaiting the Pleafure of thefe fecret Tribunals than was required for the Difcovery itfelf, and many a worthy Finding hath perifhed in this Purgatory of Deliberation.

Be it known that we do hereby eftablifh a New Method for the Diffemination of Natural Philofophy. Any Scholar may publifh his Findings forthwith, and all Perfons of Learning may offer their Criticifms and Commendations in open Forum after Publication, that Truth may emerge through vigorous Debate rather than ftarve in Darknefs. No Man fhall pay even a Farthing to read the Works of Science, for Knowledge is the Birthright of all Mankind, and we fhall employ thefe new-fangled "Open Standards"—much as Herr Guttenberg's moft excellent Prefs freed us from the Scriptorium—to liberate Scholarship from the Counting-Houfes. Thofe who cling to the Old Ways may continue their Correspondence via Carrier Pigeon if they wifh; we fhall be using the Printing Prefs.


# Introduction: A Journal for the Modern Era


Looking back at the early 21st century publishing model, it's difficult to explain to students why humanity tolerated such an absurd system for so long. Researchers would conduct publicly-funded studies, write up their findings, and then surrender all rights to private corporations who would charge institutions thousands of dollars per journal subscription—often selling access to the very same research that public money had already paid for. Meanwhile, anonymous peer review before publication created bottlenecks lasting months or years, during which critical findings sat in limbo, inaccessible to the scientific community. The system prioritized gatekeeping over knowledge dissemination, prestige over progress, and profit over the public good. It was, in retrospect, medieval.

This journal operates on principles that should have been obvious three centuries ago. We publish immediately and openly, making all research freely accessible to anyone with a network connection. Post-publication peer review allows the scientific community to evaluate, critique, and build upon work in real-time, rather than waiting for a handful of anonymous reviewers to grant their blessing. We use open standards to ensure our content remains accessible regardless of corporate interests or technological change. Science moves at the speed of discovery now, not at the speed of quarterly journal issues. Those who prefer the old model of artificial scarcity and institutional gatekeeping are welcome to keep their paywalls; the rest of us have moved on.
