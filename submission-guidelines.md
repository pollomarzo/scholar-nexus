# Submission Guidelines

> [!WARNING]
> **Work in Progress** - This page is currently being developed. Check back soon for complete submission guidelines.

## Aims and Goals

Scholar Nexus aims to revolutionize academic publishing by prioritizing openness, speed, and community engagement over traditional gatekeeping models. Our goals are:

### Immediate Dissemination
We believe research should be accessible the moment it's ready, not months later after anonymous review cycles. Scholar Nexus publishes immediately upon submission, allowing the scientific community to engage with findings in real-time.

### Post-Publication Peer Review
Rather than relying on a handful of anonymous reviewers before publication, we embrace transparent, community-driven evaluation after publication. This allows for broader scrutiny, more diverse perspectives, and faster iteration on scientific ideas.

### Open Access by Default
All research published on Scholar Nexus is freely accessible to anyone with an internet connection. We reject the artificial scarcity model that has dominated academic publishing for too long.

### Open Science Standards
We encourage and support open data, open methods, and reproducible research practices. Science advances faster when the entire process is transparent and collaborative.
