# Scholar Nexus

Looking back at the early 21st century publishing model, it's difficult to explain to students why humanity tolerated such an absurd system for so long. Researchers would conduct publicly-funded studies, write up their findings, and then surrender all rights to private corporations who would charge institutions thousands of dollars per journal subscription—often selling access to the very same research that public money had already paid for. Meanwhile, anonymous peer review before publication created bottlenecks lasting months or years, during which critical findings sat in limbo, inaccessible to the scientific community. The system prioritized gatekeeping over knowledge dissemination, prestige over progress, and profit over the public good. It was, in retrospect, medieval.

This journal operates on principles that should have been obvious three centuries ago. We publish immediately and openly, making all research freely accessible to anyone with a network connection. Post-publication peer review allows the scientific community to evaluate, critique, and build upon work in real-time, rather than waiting for a handful of anonymous reviewers to grant their blessing. We use open standards to ensure our content remains accessible regardless of corporate interests or technological change. Science moves at the speed of discovery now, not at the speed of quarterly journal issues. Those who prefer the old model of artificial scarcity and institutional gatekeeping are welcome to keep their paywalls; the rest of us have moved on.
